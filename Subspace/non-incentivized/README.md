##Polkadot.js wallet
Before running anything you need to have a wallet where you'll receive testnet coins.

Install [Polkadot.js extension](https://forum.subspace.network/t/subspace-wallet/61) into your browser and create a new account there. The address of your account will be necessary at the last step.

For help refer to our forum post [How to setup a Polkadot.JS Wallet](https://forum.subspace.network/t/subspace-wallet/61)

## Docker

wget -O docker.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Archideus/nodes_scripts/main/Subspace/non-incentivized/docker.sh && chmod +x docker.sh && sudo ./docker.sh
```

### Useful Commands (Docker), for the rest read [Docker Compose CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/).
